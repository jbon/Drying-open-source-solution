# Dryer for solid, centimetre scale
That part relate to drying of: 
- plants
- vegetables
- fruits
- nuts
- cheese
- mushroom
- more ?

For all that kind of food goods the process is almost the same, it use the same components (exept for cheese which doesn't need heating), only parameters change (temperature, time, relative humidity ...)

We try to make an inventory of all kind of dryer, and technology which could be used to dry, from the convective drying to the freeze drying, and defined each technology (electric, solar ...) used in each kind of dryers. For the 2nd level of category (convective, Freeze, IR, microwave) we choose to class them by kind of technology. Maybe, we can found a best classification.

## Convective drying
Convective drying consist of a contact between food goods and an heat and dry airflow to deshumidify food goods. It the most common process using for small products, because it's the cheaper and simpler process.

### 1. Global parameters
There is a lot of different kind of dryer, from the little dryer for domestic application to the huge dryer for industrial application, there can be organized in one block, or in some blocks, which make a more modulare system. 

#### A. Size
Actually we can’t precisely defined size in function of application, it depends of the food goods.
##### - Domestic
That’s kind of dryer could be used by a single man/women or a family for their own food.

![Domestic dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Size%20-%20Domestic%20dryer.jpg)

##### - Little production
That size of dryer, is adapted to little company, people which want to sell product at local market.

![Little production dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Size%20-%20Little%20production%20dryer.jpg)

##### - Industrial production
Dryer adapted for industrial production, sell product in large region.

![Industrial dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Size%20-%20Industrial%20production%20dryer.jpg)

#### B. Organization
#####  - Mono-bloc
That kind of organisation could be a compact organization (like a multi-bloc organization hook together) or an all in drying room organization.

Advantages:
- easy to make, no pipe to link each part
- compact

Disadvantages:
- not transportable for middle size (size of a big wardrobe) of dryer

![Compact organization](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Organization%20-%20compact%20organization.jpg)    ![All in drying room](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Organization%20-%20All%20in%20drying%20room.jpg)       ![All in drying room (2)](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Organization%20-%20All%20in%20drying%20room(2).jpg)

#####   - Multi-bloc
Advantages:
- can be move by part, maybe can be taken apart (démonté)
- modulability

Disadvantages: 
- lost energy (temperature and airflow) in pipe

![Multi-bloc](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Organization%20-%20multi-bloc.jpg)

#### C. Transportable
##### 1) Fixed
We don’t imaged that kind of dryer because it could defined by a very large panel of dryer. So we consider in that category all dryer which can’t be transport by 2 or less humans.
##### 2) Transportable
#####   - Portable
Defined by little dryer, which integrate handle or part which can be considered like handle, and which can be transport by maximum 2 peoples.

![Portable](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Transportable%20-%20Portable.jpg)

#####   - Pliable
The same restriction than a “portable” dryer, which pliable part to make an easy to transport dryer when it necessary.

![Pliable](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Transportable%20-%20Pliable.png)

#####   - Wheel
Dryer which integrate one or more wheel to transport it.

![big one](http://forum.latelierpaysan.org/download/file.php?id=3759&sid=fe2318ce1701ca44640fd474b1e526d4)
![2 Wheels](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Transportable%20-%20Wheels.jpg)

### 2. Drying room
#### A. Materials
We don't find European restriction for indirect contact, like it appear with drying room in a dryer. In that case, food goods can stay in the same room during few days with the same air, so we consider indirect contact like direct contact, we work later more presicely about that question. Maybe restriction could be simplified if the dryer work with renewable air.
(See under for more precision)

#### - Stone – Building:
Dryer directly integrate in a building. It can vary from old building (like an attic) to modern building with waxed concrete. For that part, we need to study food grade materials to identified what kind of material could be used, almost sure waxed concrete is legal, the rest need more study.

We think than, for nuts and that kind of fruit, dryer don't need to be totally clean, but for other kind of products building have to be really clean. 

![Traditional nuts dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Materials%20-%20Stone%20building.jpg)

#### - Steel
Steel is a good solution for fruits and vegetables dryers, which need to be wash with water after each utilization, so stainless steel is easy to clean and it's resilient.

*[French source](http://www.contactalimentaire.com/index.php?id=204&L=1%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%5C%27%60%28%5B%7B%5E%7E)*

![Stainless dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Materials%20-%20steel%20-%20stainless.jpg)

#### - Wood:
Wood is easiest material to make by oneself, but it doesn't work to any solutions, like with humid product (see under) which need to clean drying room with food grade cleaning product.

![Wood dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Materials%20-%20wood.jpg)

#### - Plastic
Plastic is a good solution for fruits and vegetables dryers, which need to be wash with water after each utilization, so plastic is easy to clean but it isn't resilient.

![Plastic dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Materials%20-%20plastic.jpg)

#### - Varnish materials
What kind of varnish could be used, what the maximum rate of product could be used.

- Vanish for wood
For fruit and vegetable dryers which need to be clean with water, wood without vanish can't reply to that restriction. So to vanish wood could be a great solution to have an easy to make dryer and respect very restricted alimentary regulation.

#### - cleaning products
You need to clean materials and objects, which could be in contact with food goods, before each using.


#### B. Shape
That the very hard part of the state of art, a lot of forms of dryer was experiment since the first realisation 12 000 years before, so we try to make the most complete list of kind of dryer, to inspire us and other to during the design of there dryer.
Maybe some dryers which can be regroup in the same category but to be sure to list all kind of dryer, we separate all little difference.
#### - Shell type (indirect solar natural convection)

![Shell Type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20shell%20type.jpg)

#### - Vertical type with trays

![Vertical with trays](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20vertical%20type%20with%20trays.jpg)

#### - Spread type (solar direct):
Spread dryer, is a special form of vertical dryer, adapt to solar direct application, but it can be used in different case but that’s not real useful.

![Spread type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20spread%20type.jpg)

#### - Tunnel type
That’s more or less the same system than spread type, but for that category we exclude direct solar input. So, all kind of heat source could be considered. 

![Tunnel type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20tunnel%20type.jpg)     ![Tunnel type(2)](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20tunnel%20type(2).jpg)

#### - Rotative cylinder type
More adapted for cereals, and that kind of products. That kind of dryer is composed of a rotative drying room, which is crossed by an airflow. It provide to dry equitably all products. It doesn't need trays, but it need an high level of complexity. It more adapted for industrial applications.

![Rotative cylinder type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20rotative%20cylinder%20type.jpg)     ![Rotative cylinder type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20rotative%20cylinder%20type(2).jpg)

#### - Silo type

![Silo type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20silo%20type.JPG)

#### - Screw dryer type

![screw dryer type](http://www.amb-rousset.com/wp-content/uploads/1702/12/SRN-AUD-L04-012223-vue-de-cote.jpg)

#### 3 Supplying systems
#### 3.1 Containing systems
Trays is the most using system to display product for artisanal or industrial application (exept for industrial drying of cereals), but other systems could be used in different applications.

For example, people who just want to dry some plants suspend bunch in an hot room ...

#### 3.1.1 Loosely

##### 3.1.1.1 Reversal
##### - Screw 
See [Screw dryer](http://www.amb-rousset.com/products/sechoir-a-vis/) or [another dryer](http://www.heinkel.com/products/dryers-and-mixers/conical-screw-vacuum-dryer.aspx)

##### 3.1.1.2 Not reversal

##### - Cylindric contener - Silo
![Silo type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20silo%20type.JPG)

##### - Square contener - Bac

![square contener](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fermedelaguilbardiere.fr%2Fimages%2Fdossiers%2Fhistorique%2F36-115906.jpg&f=1)

#### 3.1.2 Scatter

##### 3.1.2.1 Trays

Trays is most common solution for convective dryer, exept cereal dryer, which use bigger contener.

##### 3.1.2.1.1 Support

##### - Fabric
Maybe the best fabric solution is mosquito net (~7 €/linear meter) because, air can easy cross it, but verify alimentary application before.

![Tray with fabric](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Drying%20rack%20-%20fabric.jpg)

##### - Screen
Different kinds of screen could be used, for example:
- fine grillage: it isn't an alimentary material, verify regulation before to use something
- alimentary grille: generally using for oven or aging rack
- ripening mat for cheese: that's a good solution because, it make for alimentary application so, there isn't problem with respect of regulation. Exist in different materials: plastic, inox

![Fromagex - ripening mat](https://www.fromagex.com/can/media/catalog/product/cache/2/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_20198_1_1835_262_10588.jpg)

![alimentary grille](http://www.materiel-cuisson-frigorifique.com/back/images_article/201207190116714.jpg)

##### 3.1.2.1.2 Spread thickness
For plant drying you can choose to spread it by thick layer, you need to adapt the system for that kind of spreading, avoid pressure loss.
For cutted fruit and vegetable, you need to spread product in thin layer.

##### - Thin layers
Adavantage:
- work with natural convection

Disadvantage:
- long time of supplying

![Thin layer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Spread%20system%20-%20Thin%20layer.JPG)

##### - Thick layers
Adavantage:
- easy to supply

Disadvantage:
- pressure loss (need forced convection)

![Thick layer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Spread%20system%20-%20Thick%20layer.JPG)

##### 3.1.2.2 Bar
That kind of display is more adapt to long product or to plant bunch.
![Bar](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Drying%20rack%20-%20bar.jpg)    ![Bar(2)](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Drying%20rack%20-%20bar(2).jpg)

##### 3.1.2.3 Pic
Maybe with that technic, you can dry more fruit or vegetable than with trays, but it need more time to spread them.

![Pic](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Drying%20rack%20-%20pic.jpg)

##### 3.1.2.4 String
More adapted for plant bunch, you can tie plant together and suspend them. It's a very tedious technic but which doesn't need any construction.

![Plant bunch](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jardinerenville.fr%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F11%2Fplante1.jpg&f=1)

### 4. Heat source
Heat source is one of technical problem of dryer. Between effectiveness and energy independence, there is a real work to search what kind of heat source to what kind of application, to optimize known heat source and to mix some kind of heat source.

Maximal temperature depend of the product. Some tables indicate temperature and time to each products.

### A. Solar (warm and non pollute flow)
Solar heating is maybe the simplest system to dry food goods, but you really dependant of sunray. Generally, drying is practice during good season, but a session last more than one day, so drying stop during the night. 
### Kind of caption
#### - Direct:
The most simple application for solar energy, sun heat directly the product. Generally, heating across a transparent film, to using greenhouse effect to increase temperature, but sunray destroy some of nutritive components of the product.
You can also do it without transparent film.

![Solar direct](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Heat%20source%20-%20solar%20direct.jpg)

#### - Indirect:
It consist to using solar thermal panels, link to the drying room.

##### - Glassed
In that system, sunray cross glass before heat a dark plate. After greenhouse effect increase temperature in the panel. Simply, the system can be a box with one side glassed.

To optimize it:
- double glazing: it increase greenhouse effect and isolation of the system. To optimize double glazing insolation, you can increase distance between glasses until 4mm. After a convective in space between the glasse reduce isolation.
- darkest plate: it increase absorption sunray. for greenhouse effect, we need to have the sunray which can't cross glassed when they're inside the box. Dark material modify frequency of sunray. With there new frequency they more block in the panel.
- external isolation: it increase temperature conservation in the box

To size your solar panel:
- For plant, you need nearly third of meter square of panel of the weight of your production.
- for fruits and vegetables:
- ...

#### C. Warm and pollute flow
That kind of heat source need a heat exchanger to separate pollute flow and drying flow.
#### Heat exchanger 
(source: http://www.uk-exchangers.com/heat-exchange-products/air-to-air-heat-exchangers/)
Different kind of heat exchanger can be used to transfer energy from 1st fluid to a 2nd fluid. For beginning, we stay only in airflow exchanger.

### 5. Convection
#### A. Kind
There is 2 kind of airflow creation using in dryer:
- natural convection: the airflow isn't pulsed
- forced convection: the airflow is pulsed by an additional system

##### Natural convection
It Work with rising warm airflow, so the airflow isn't pulsed by an additional system.

So that kind of system generally use the natural caracteristic of warmflow to go up.

That's a very simple system to make but it can't be regulate to improve drying, or just to avoid too high temperature with increase airflow.

![Natural convection](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Convection%20-%20natural.jpg)

##### Forced convection
Forced convection consist of a system which pulse airflow, to increase speed of drying, principally for 2 reasons.
- For a professionnal application, producer need to have bigger production to respond to there financial need
- With decrease of drying time, nutrient concentration increase. Drying is a physical chemistry reaction which deteriorate nutrient, so the faster is the best, but the faster need more energy.

##### - Electrical

That's the more common solution for professional application, more expensive and complicated to make, with that kind of system, you can regulate the drying.

![Forced convection - electrical](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Convection%20-%20forced%20-%20electrical.jpg)

##### - Wind forced
That kind of system is autonomous in energy, but it need to have access to wind and can't be regulate.

![Forced convection - wind](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Convection%20-%20forced%20-%20wind.jpg)

#### B. Direction
In that part we only speak for trays, in other kind of system, direction of the convection could be different.

##### Perpendicular to the trays
The more common system use in DIY system because the easiest system to make and that work for each kind of product.

![Convection perpendicular to the trays](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Convection%20-%20perpendicular%20to%20the%20trays.jpg)

##### Parallel to the trays
Only use for thin layer (all cutted fruit and vegetable, thin layer of plant), it's the most efficient choice because it divide warm airflow in all product and it limit pressure loss.

#### B. Closed pipe

You can find a dehumidifier with a ventilation system. That's make a complete system to dry. Easy to instal and run, but you can't adjust it like you want. Generally, only one button to adjust all parameters. That's the simplest solution but not the more precise. If you out it in a little box, it could to heat too much, so you need to stop the system (manually or automatically).

### 6. Automation

### 7. Alimentary legislation

We can distinct 2 kind of using material in a dryer:
- Direct contact: materials wich be in a direct contact with food goods. For example, the trays or other kind of spreading have a direct contact with food goods. So for that kind of restriction there is European restriction about that which integrate certain restriction for each kind of materials (plastic, wood ...)
- Indirect contact: materials which don't have direct contact, like the drying room, but have a direct contact with airflow. For that kind of materials, there is a difference between plant (maybe cereals too) and fruit and vegetable, by the difference of humidity and sugar, in the product. In the 1st hand, it need only to clean dust, and in the other hand, it need to clean eventual  caramel on the side.

#### Direct contact
The best way to respect restriction is to use food grade product, but we try to popularize restriction to divert other material and products.

European laws indicate regulation for direct contact, so there isn't direct contact with nuts, they don't need food grade materials.(verify that information)

For direct alimentary contact, it need to respect [European regulation](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2016/581411/EPRS_STU%282016%29581411_EN.pdf) which identify inertia of the material. It depend of:
- materials composition
- migration's treshold in food goods, of substance which composed materials
- lack of deterioration of organoleptic properties (taste, smell, sight and touch) by materials

There is specific criteria for:
- materials which could be treat (ionization, recycling ...) 
- coloring materials
- cleaning product using on material which have contacte with good foods

#### Steel
Steel is a good solution for fruits and vegetables dryers, which need to be wash with water after each utilization, so stainless steel is easy to clean and it's resilient.

Like it's precise before, for each kind of material there is special restriction about there inertial ctriteria.
Inertial criteria to respect are:
- chemical composition ([European laws in french](http://www.contactalimentaire.com/fileadmin/ImageFichier_Archive/contact_alimentaire/Fichiers_Documents/Brochure_JO/Note_2004_64/Fiches_DGCCRF_Revisees/DGCCRF-Fiches-metaux-alliages.pdf)
- limit of undesirable elements:
	- Lead (Plomb): < 0.05 %
	- Cadmium: < 0.01 %
	- Arsenic: < 0.03 %
	- ...
- specific migration of metalic element :
	- Nickel < 0.5 mg/kg of food goods
	- Chrome < 5 mg/kg of food goods
	- Zinc < 10 mg/kg of food goods
	- Lead < 4 mg/kg of food goods
	- cadmium < 0.3 mg/kg of food goods
	-...

#### - Wood:
For European regulation, 2 categories of criteria could influence the choice :
- wood variety:
	- accept all food goods: oak, sweet chestnut, ash, hornbeam, black locust, pine, spruce, douglas, maritime pine, scotch pine, poplar, beech, plane, aspen, alder, olive, birch
	- only for solid food goods: walnut, elm, 
- essence de bois: 
	- pour tout les aliments : chêne, châtaignier, frêne, charme, robinier, sapin, épicéa, douglas, pin maritime, pin sylvestre, peuplier, hêtre, platane, tremble, aulne, olivier, bouleau
	- pour les solide alimentaires : hêtre, noyer, orme, peuplier
- wood treatment: 
	- no pentachlorophenol treatment (< 0,1 mg/kg of wood)
	- ?
- traitement du bois : 
	- Absence de traitement au pentachlorophénol (< 0,1 mg/kg de bois)
	- Produits de traitement autorisés pour les emballages de fruits et légumes

*[french source](http://www.contactalimentaire.com/index.php?id=382)*

#### - Plastic
Plastic is a good solution for fruits and vegetables dryers, which need to be wash with water after each utilization, so plastic is easy to clean but it isn't resilient.
Inertial criteria to respect is decompose of 3 categories:
- global restriction about substances
- global limit of migration: < 10 mg/dm² (for material which used to babies good foods (< 3years), the limit is 60 mg/dm²)
- specific limit of migration

*[French source](http://www.contactalimentaire.com/index.php?id=250), and [other](http://www.contactalimentaire.com/fileadmin/ImageFichier_Archive/contact_alimentaire/Fichiers_Documents/autres/Fiches-materiaux-organiques-matieres-synthetiques.pdf)*

#### - Varnish materials
What kind of varnish could be used, what the maximum rate of product could be used.

- Vanish for wood
For fruit and vegetable dryers which need to be clean with water, wood without vanish can't reply to that restriction. So to vanish wood could be a great solution to have an easy to make dryer and respect very restricted alimentary regulation.

#### Indirect contact

Restriction about indirect contact is about cleaning material we can distinct 2 kind of product:
- humid products: like fruit and vegetable which need to be clean with liquid product after each utilisation. Indeed humid material dirty the interior of the drying room because of high level of sugar or other component in airflow.
- other products: like plant and cereal which need to clean dust in the dryer.

#### - Varnish materials
What kind of varnish could be used, what the maximum rate of product could be used.

- Vanish for wood
For fruit and vegetable dryers which need to be clean with water, wood without vanish can't reply to that restriction. So to vanish wood could be a great solution to have an easy to make dryer and respect very restricted alimentary regulation.
