Contribution guide
==================

This project is open to any interested person wanting to contribute, whatever
their motivations, may they be personal or professional, and whatever their
competences. The more we are, the better the dryer will be and the higher the
chances will be that it will be actually used.

Donâ€™t hesitate to participate in one or more of the following activities:

1.  Promotion of the project (speak or report about the project, share links and
    so on)

2.  [Idea
    sourcing](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/tree/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts)

    1.  [Propose ideas to
        develop](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/issues)

    2.  Document existing designs

    3.  [Organised state of
        art](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art.md)

    4. Document drying science with engineer, scientific and farmer point of view

3.  [Development](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/tree/master/02%20-%20Developing):
    [Formalisation of technical
    problems](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/tree/master/02%20-%20Developing/01%20-%20Functional%20analysis)
    (Functional analysis)

    1.  Propose and develop technical solution (FAST - Function Analysis System
        Technique)

    2.  Organization of technical solution in the process (SADT - Structured
        Analysis and Design Technic)

    3.  Choice of technical solutions

    4.  Design technical solution (CAD)

    5.  Model the product to create physical model - Writing documentation to
        fabricate the product

4.  Protyping (test the design, share and analyse test results)

5.  Production (make and sell the product, train people to make it)

How to propose an idea and reporting a creation
-----------------------------------------------

-   Propose an idea: Actually the simpler solution is to post an
    [issue](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/issues).
    Once create, may be to speak about that proposition like on a forum,
    detailled it, modify it ...

-   Report a dryer: You can report dryers make with a new .odt file (1 file by
    dryer)

-   Organise different technology of dryer's components. On [state of
    art](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art.odt),
    we try to organise different components usable in a dryer, there advantages
    and there disadvantages.

How to participate in the development
-------------------------------------

It's the bigger part of the project, it begin with statement of the need, the
aim of the product and finish with prototyping documentation. Functional
analysis - Formalise technical problems : "How we want to the product work ?" :
For that we distinguish different phase : - Using phase - Clean phase ...

For each phase, we create functions which can describe precise need. Generally,
they're 3 kind of functions :

-   Principal function : that's the aim of the product, \~ Dry food

-   Using functions : that's optimisation functions for a good utilisation of
    the system, like "Be ergonomic"

-   Constraint functions : that the limit of the other functions, like "Don't
    burn food"

To develop (and propose) technical solutions, we use FAST diagrams. It's an
abstract technique to generate and organize technical functions and technical
solutions.

To choose technical solutions, we use, SADT diagrams. It's a more concrete
solution, which place each action in relation to other action, and make plan of
the process.

Prototyping

We are not so far... coming soon, hopefully!
